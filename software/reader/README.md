# RFID Reader Software

## Local Development Environment Set-Up

This code in this directory was made using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with the [PlatformIO extention](https://platformio.org/). To get started:

1. Download and install Visual Studio Code: [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
2. Download the PlatformIO core [instructions](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#installation-methods) (this is optional - but lets you use the serial monitor from the command line which is nice)
2. Install the PlatformIO VS Code extension: [instructions](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#ide-vscode)

Once this is done, you can open this directory as a project in Visual Studio Code.

## Serial Monitor

If you install the [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#installation-methods) then you should have the `pio` command installed and available from the command line. This lets you use the [Serial Device Monitor](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/userguide/device/cmd_monitor.html#pio-device-monitor).
